# CMSI 186 Lab 2 Virtual Darts Starter Code

This repository contains some unfinished Java programs for you to complete.

Import this repository into a new repository of your own and write the code according to the lab [instructions](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/plab/lab/2/). Use the provided test scripts as you complete the programs.

In your new repository, don’t forget to completely edit this README file, as _your_ repository will not contain any “unfinished Java programs.” Consider adding a fun image, but not _too_ fun, as your GitHub repository will be checked by prospective employers.
